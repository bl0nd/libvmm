# **Libvmm**

Libvmm provides common virtualization components for Virtual Machine Monitor
(VMM) and hypervisor development.

VMMs and hypervisors often share common components (e.g., VM lifecycle/resource
management via KVM, I/O virtualization via virtio). Unfortunately, these pieces
are typically reimplemented for each project, resulting in duplicated efforts
and boring drudge work. The goal of Libvmm is to prevent this redundancy.
