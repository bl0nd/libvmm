# **Libvmm**

Libvmm provides common virtualization components for Virtual Machine Monitor
(VMM) and hypervisor development.

VMMs and hypervisors often share common components (e.g., VM lifecycle and
resource management via KVM API, I/O virtualization via virtio, etc.).
However, these components are typically reimplemented for each project,
resulting in duplicated effort and forcing developers to perform drudge work
before even starting their project.
