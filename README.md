# **Libvmm**

Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) and hypervisors often share common
virtualization components (e.g., management/configuration of VMs via KVM API,
I/O virtualization via virtio platform). However, these components are typically
reimplemented for each project, resulting in duplicated efforts and forcing
developers to perform drudge work before even starting their project.
