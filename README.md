# **Libvmm**

Libvmm provides common virtualization components for Virtual Machine Monitor
(VMM) and hypervisor development.

VMMs and hypervisors often share common bits and pieces (e.g., VM lifecycle and
resource management via KVM, I/O virtualization via virtio). Unfortunately,
these components are typically reimplemented for each project, resulting in
duplicated efforts and boring drudge work. Hopefully, Libvmm can help you avoid
all that.
